Ranveer  questions about death is permanent 😅\n\nIntegrity is like lord ram. What in his mind( logic ) , what  is in his heart(emotions ) and what is in hand ( action ). All are  one.  That means if u want be something, then it should be logically right for you, it should be emotionally good for u, give peace to u and it should be in your reach, means u must have resources for it. That&#39;s all🙂\n\nTeachers are very wrong in india. They teach wrong. They don&#39;t bother about what is hidden potential and interest of a child. Their words are different, and their action are different. They don&#39;t know anything about integrity. They just greedy fool pshyco people. The teachers of india are mostly pshyco, greedy and lusty. This is I&#39;m saying from my experience\n\nThe way Robert sir teach is very interesting and direct go to head\n\nHonestly Mr kiyosaki is on another level to be able to grasp what he was actually meaning. Do you really get his philosophy?\n\nThanks Sir for bringing up this type of podcast with Robert Kiyosaki ❤\n\nSome statements can&#39;t be understood. He might want to say between the lines!\n\nThere is nothing wrong with Communists ideology. It focuses more on welfare of the people. Only flaw is that the  system naturally create a despotic government and make it hard to become rich and exploit people.\n\nyou went to vietnam to kill people because you were helping an imperialit country not because lyou were fighting for democracy\n\nThis is my first time on this channel. It&#39;s because of Robert kiyosaki\n\nThe anchor is under pressure, finding it challenging to keep up with the guest&#39;s intellectual thoughts. Robert&#39;s statements seem like rocket science, catching the anchor off guard. It would have been beneficial for the anchor to study him before inviting him to the show.\n\nOld man screaming at the clouds\n\nWe are PEOPLE!!! THE BEST SAYING EVER!!!!! I DONT LIKE THAT PEOPLE JUDGE A PERSON WHAT RACE WE ARE! IVE ALWAYS HATED IT!!! I SAY OUR SOULD HAS NO COLOR.\n\nHow much Money does one person need?\n\nThat a lie cuz when I I have paper money I can but what I need.\n\nSilver is the best investment\n\nToo many Commercials.\n\nOverall I see one of the best opportunities Ranveer had got but due to his lack of communication skills it has been wasted, I think he could have done better than this but being in the situation is far more intese by rather than seeing it. Still it was a informational podcast. You can do better Ranveer. Focus on your hands.\n\nBiden is Evil\n\nThe only thing I learnt from this podcast:<br>💵 : this is toilet paper<br>🪙 : this is money<br>😂\n\nPlease bring   Annamalai’s to your show ❤\n\nIs it just me who thinks that whenever you ask Mr. Kiyosaki a question, he will tell you everything except for the answer of the question?\n\nCheap cheap cheap 🤌🤌🤌🤌😂\n\nHe is right. America is screwed  up by Obama and Biden. 😢.\n\nYou dont understand a word I say, do you? 😂😂😂😂😂\n\nI anticipate positive growth in the markets for 2024, and I&#39;m considering investing $220k in stocks for my retirement plan due to recent rate cuts. Could you provide guidance on executing this investment safely? Additionally, are there any crucial tips or changes I should be mindful of in the current financial landscape?\n\nI dont know y i think robert ivested most of the money in silver.. And this s d way to get a spike😂😂\n\nCoz if ranveer&#39;s stupid expression.. He s keep saying u dont understand wt i am saying do you😂😂😂\n\nThe future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. Success is a state of mind. I think I&#39;m blessed because if not I wouldn&#39;t have met someone who is as spectacular as Expert Mrs Lucy Mary Liam.\n\nI love him and you brother that&#39;s a powerful energy getting from u and him,,,<br>Best podcast i have ever seen\n\nCapitalists are not suitable for this kind of podcast, they lives real life not believe in reel life story 🤓🤓\n\nBro I would say you were lost while in conversation with Robert and I got it. He had said you are not understanding what I am saying multiple times. Accept it that you were lost about what he was saying.\n\nTHANK YOU AND ROBERT!\n\nOh my god…. This is one of the best insightful interview ever\n\nI read many of his books and respect him. I agree with his opinion a lot, and I found that he sounds like a teacher.✨🌟no offense just a comment. Thank you for your uploads and wish both of you and everyone here further success and happiness! 🎉🎉🎉\n\nGreat session!\n\nYou should watch visi trust me bro😊\n\nEvery question has same answer just 2-3 words are different\n\nBro it&#39;s time to call Andrew tate please\n\nNext time....Brian Tracy\n\nHe says he hates teachers and yet he is a teacher. Go figure 🧐\n\nHe has escaped the MATRIX\n\nGodfather of debt 😂\n\nyuo dont know dont you\n\namericans telling their portfolio of 500k or 1m, indians still riding bicycle and living at annual salary of 4k dollars but 1m - 100million dollars on property investment and gold investment since 1000s of years\n\nInvesting prospects of a minimal sum of money can be both exhilarating and baseless. With the right approach, there’s a potential for significant wealth growth, Judging by this i&#39;m still in search for suggestions as to a way to improve my retirement portfolio of $580k\n\n&quot;The rich own commodities&quot;\n\nFab podcast and appreciate it\n\nThank goodness you brought this up! Truly, investing has changed my perspective on how one can succeed in life; working multiple jobs isn&#39;t the optimal way to attain financial freedom and unfortunately, we discover this later in life. Currently earn as much as 10 grand weekly and this has improved my financial life. Great piece!\n\nAs an investing enthusiast, I often wonder how top level investors are able to become millionaires off investing. I’ve been sitting on over $545K equity from a home sale and I’m not sure where to go from here, is it a good time to buy into stocks or do I wait for another opportunity?.\n\nDeath is common in all podcast😂\n\nRobert :  “Your not listening”. 😂\n\nVery nice to see this podcast I really love this episode my idol robert kiyosaki\n\nRanveer has little knowledge about money so he didn’t ask the useful question, he is keep bringing India when Robert was talking having point of view of worldwide economy.\n\nBhai iska ek Hindi me bhi sobbed kr ke aploade kr do\n\nYou are missing great opportunity\n\nIt&#39;s not a good conversation, you are not comfortable with Q saki\n\nI think you&#39;re biased ! Well not me but my students from mexico think that way.\n\nWhy don&#39;t joe rogan has Robert t. Kiyosaki\n\nWell @trs simply doesn&#39;t have the mental capacity and the knowledge to pull off this sort of conversation. Robert deserved at better host.\n\nRobert took this wannabe &quot;i know it all&quot; for a ride. @trs wake up to the reality\n\nOne of his most awkward podcast he ever did i feel him 😭\n\nRanveer always has some dumb questions..but I only watch is that the guests were always great people..other than that ranveer is one the world&#39;s worst podcaster. He&#39;s just dumb..\n\nHis book change the mindset 😊\n\nI wonder how an interview with Robert could be so messed up by an interviewer like this. Taking the discussions tangentially,reducing the value of this sustantially with each and svery questions.\n\nThe host is a stupid guy, Robert skipped a lot of questions posted by him because the host couldn’t get his ideas across clearly &amp; correctly. Host didn’t even understand the word “integrity “!\n\nthis guy wasted Robert kiyosaki&#39;s time and my time, such a great opportunity to ask useful technical questions that could help us, just stick to money topic. He&#39;s expert on money so ask him questions of his expertise, whats this nonsenses you wanna ask everyone about happiness, death, spirituality..... total waste of time. Sharan did a much better a useful podcast. I never heard word debt from ranveer throughout the podcast, i opened this podcast just to know more about debt and money,  how robert uses debt...etc how he bought oil wells.....\n\nWhy does Robert keep saying the same thing in every podcast? Every time someone asks a question that’s not regarding money. He somehow brings it back extremely smart, and knows how to market his products very well I think one thing I learned from watching his podcast you don’t have to follow the trend. Follow what your heart desires, guided with the right intentions, and have integrity. Trust yourself do what’s right, even when no one‘s looking.\n\nI start investing small amount in FD after reading rich dad poor dad .. it’s working money work for me in small quantities .. I believe one day I will able to invest in silver and gold and real state also .. god bless me with wealth 😊😊\n\nRobert sir has taken interview to this guy lol\n\nUncle&#39;s jawline is still sharper then a blade\n\n76 years old man hates Biden bcse he cut off his Canada-Mexico oil pipes or whatever he said. <br><br>Just my perception from this episode- Robert has lost his mind, this is just age effect. I wish he would speak more about his book and his core aspirations writing Rich Dad Poor Dad. <br><br>I suspect this episode was meant to be lengthy one but Ranveer called it off early bcse he was unable to be aligned with Robert fully. <br><br>Learning from this episode: hear their (old successful people) history but do no follow them cs world is changing\n\nWow... please call gay gauri Sawant or Pooja Sharma like personalities on this show highly requested\n\nRanveer, no matter person on the front of you is how big, if you think you disagree on some points, challenge them for debate, I feel like you wants to say things but you stayed quite because he made you thought you are stupid by saying things like, are you even listening, are you able to understand? He was nice person but his personality kind of challenge person on the front of him for debate 😂\n\nHow to talk with someone knowledgeable and senior person 🧍 should be learnt from Ranveer, great talk shows 👍\n\nWhen people ask me how I got rich, I tell them: I studied DEBT\n\nbroo ranveer you were not even able to understand what he was saying he was exhausted\n\nThis guy is so badly outclassed... God this is uncomfortable to watch!😅\n\nHow many of you are planing to invest in silver after thsi podcast...i know I m😊\n\nHost is absolutely clueless\n\nFirst time Ranveer is trying very hard to get the conversation going. This American is one bad aas mf\n\nRanveer you didn’t research this guy well .. he was in a different plane &amp; you were in a different galaxy…\n\nPrecious metal is the best investment - take home advice\n\nRobert is very deep personality. The host is doing his best but he is not able to take the best out of him.\n\nNow carry is looking nerd to roast you\n\nThe part where you spoke about investing really stuck with me. I&#39;m a watch lover and I own a vintage military submariner Rolex(family heirloom). The goal is to become a multimillionaire, retire and live off my investments. I own a few real estate rentals, I play around with stocks and crypto but I&#39;d love to take it very seriously this year. Is it possible to retire at 45 with $20million? I&#39;m currently 32 and that&#39;s my utmost goal.\n\nRanvir bhai 🙏🙏\n\nUnbelievable ❤❤❤\n\n👌\n\nWho is one here after watching reels.. I&#39;m one one them.. happy to see robbert kiyosaki in India\n\nFirst time Ranveer asked valuable questions\n\nRanveer is like a little girl.\n\nBecause America have no farm land or exports of farm products to other countries they become bankrupt and waste ptoduct that can be recycled\n\nGuys does anyone know why did he say invest in silver ?\n\nThis is overrated. He could have asked more about money related things😢\n\ni think this is the most toughest interview u did till date<a href=\"UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/W8IfY_bwAfiPq7IPvNCA2AU\"></a>\n\nHe has $1.2 Billion Debt 😢😂\n\nMe to yahi bolunga akhir me bhaiyya hi bana diya robert ko isne as like bhaiyya lok do😂😂😂😂\n\nEverything was good except flattery man.\n\nI think Ranveer should prepare more interesting questions. Its jus silly questions\n\nHe&#39;s jus insulting Ranveer &amp; India and Indians clapping for him. Idiots\n\nJust asking stupid questions.\n\nRanveer has no idea wht Robert kiyosaki actually saying.\n\nJust Robert thinks &quot;U are an idiot ranveer 😂&quot;\n\nGuys.... This is the most serious podcaste of my life a very dengerous thing is comming.. that&#39;s ai and wars...as I expected Robert is the man who do not afraid of anyone I like his thinking a lot and I really get inspired by him.... The most famous qoute of his is money is just a toilet paper throung you can buy poop only.....\n\nI have watched this mans podcast with 3 different people. This guy is just repeating same thing over and over again.<br>He&#39;s correct actually but he just repeats same thing.\n\nNever expected that\n\nRobert has gone a little senile. Repeating same points, keep going into the far past, using same arguments over and over. <br>It taught me the power of time,  once a respected author is now somewhat strugling to keep his mind in check.\n\nYe banda alag level ka pagal hai bhai.. good video\n\nAsk Vivek Ramaswamy to join your show, he would not turn it down\n\nBoom❤😂\n\nThis interview is like When “money” meets “innocence”😂\n\nWhen Robert called out Ranveer multiple times and made sure that he understands that he has 0 knowledge of what he is talking about.\n\nFirst gain some knowledge @Ranveer and prepare what type of questions to ask.\n\nOk ok ok ok 😀😀😀\n\nSir Robert really really hate biden\n\nSystumm\n\nJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJAJA\n\nWtf, now uneducated people are taking interviews of educated people😮\n\nJust be honest... Ranveer na zara b achy Questions nhi pochy 🥲 he was just trying to repeat the boring Question and Robert sir was try to explain money and Ranveer was putting him in a Situation where money Is not very interesting thing\n\nThank you Ranveer\n\nAnd that&#39;s all, that&#39;s enough\n\nnow this episode was intense..\n\nNo immigrants! Everyone stay in their own country. This is NOT RASISM.  You mainstream media people have sold your souls! YOU LADY TAKE 10 MUSLIMS TO YOUR OWN HOME. YOU WILL HAVE FUN. SIIIICK\n\nIn fact that&#39;s a lie unfortunately. We have loads of immigrants but the government is saying untrue stories to Polish People...\n\nBro you look so uneducated in front of him and it&#39;s like your forceing to say something but his not going that way 😂😂\n\nPlease ask the relevant questions about money and finance only..<br><br>Robert kiyosaki will not come easily every time..<br><br>So please ask only financial related questions<br><br><br><br><br>....you are asking irrelevant questions like life goals and alll<br><br>That is really disappointing\n\nThe greatest book i have ever read\n\nCommunism and Satanism are pretty much the same thing\n\nPeaceful people? I am sure he&#39;s in Mumbai..koi Delhi bhejo isko 😂<br><br>Financial fraud + anger dono dikh jayega waha 😂😂😂 then he&#39;ll be like &quot;Invest in security&quot;  😁\n\nRanveer seems uncomfortable on the unexpected responses from Robert. Seems this podcast doesn&#39;t go well with Robert as he is repeating the same thing again and again and have some imaginary stuff in his mind which spoil this podcast.\n\nkiyosaki is a fraud afaik...he talks a lot but he isn&#39;t rich...\n\nBhai galt insan se bhid gye wo content nhi knowledge Dene aye hai joke p mood khrab hora h unka😂❤\n\n31/12/2023\n\nBhai Ranveer , thodasa toh hawa tight ho gaya tha Mera bhi bs yeh dekhne Mai. But my man stayed strong. It was a pain watching you a kind struggling 😅😅\n\nCome on! You asked him all the wrong questions dude\n\nCapitalism brings out the worst in humanity\n\nBetter questions next time please from which people can learn something\n\nOne of the best interview in my life👏👏👏 great job.\n\nBhai honestly, not disrespecting you<br>But u are not matching the levels of communication with robert sir.Many times u got uncomfortable where u have with you only your good smile that says all\n\nOMG who&#39;s next\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byJgRDFdUj0&amp;t=600\">10:00</a> hahaha lmao 😂\n\nThis is a very poorly done interview.   I don’t think Ranveer understood anything that Robert has narrated.   Most of the time Ranveer is in loss of questions and Robert repeats the same thing again and again.   Such annoying and boring stuff.\n\nplease someone expalin what does he mean by<br>this is not money<br>this is money,silver<br>let me know\n\nWhat&#39;s coming next ....war.....no AI....😂😂\n\nRobert K was great but I felt as though Ranveer didn’t get his assignment right as he seemed lost and couldn’t keep his guest engaged or ask right questions!!disappointed …\n\nNext - Ranveer has elon musk or trump on his podcast\n\n&quot;You don&#39;t hear a word that I say&quot; ... I can feel his frustration😂\n\nRanveer has been roasted like a chicken 😂\n\nI feel Robert might be losing his marbles a bit now. He is transparent which I respect. But his style is a bit demeaning. Suggestion for the host: draw the line every now &amp; then. He cant cross that line as far as demeaning you. ‘You don’t understand a word I am saying do you?’ ‘So you saying my people are lying?’ There was no need for comments as this from Robert ‘sir’. This shows he is using a power tactic to intimidate others into accepting his thoughts (which by the way is highly outdated now). Only ch 1 of Rich Dad Poor Dad is maybe relevant any more\n\nWow, what an uncomfortable 30 mins it was for Ranveer.<br>Still good to watch.\n\nMark my comment Trump will be next president of America and I hope Ranveer will bring him on his podcast. When ranveer was just making his gym videos from that days I am following him. I hope he brings Trump to his podcast in India in his studio. I will pray for this day.\n\nranvir was not confident bz he has not done research for this\n\nSorry to say, Ranveer didn&#39;t had the capacity to handle this personality\n\nhow many times Mr. Kiosaki mentioned to Ranveer &#39;I don&#39;t think you understand me&#39;....they were poles apart in this podcast...this man is so clear in his thoughts.\n\nMay be ranveer got unexpected answers. And iam sure many answers he doesn’t agree with mr robert . But what he speaking and preaching he is doing it. He has integrity and at one point of interview ranveer checking his integrity i guess. This is one of the great interview\n\nYe episode me Ranveer ko ek bhi baar robert sir ne unke point pakadne nahi diya , we want more intelligent people like him to come on TRS\n\nHe carries coins , notes and books in all podcasts 🤣🤣🤣🤣\n\nRanveer bhai ko pta nhi chla ki bhaiya kya bat kr rhe hai.\n\nHe&#39;s such a strong personality.. Ranveer failed to adapt and respond accordingly.. His comment on AI taking jobs already effects here\n\nI think they have been somewhat out of sync in their talk. He couldn&#39;t get the answers from Robert, like he usually gets from other guests in his show\n\n@BeerBuceps Ranveer has no idea what Robert is talking about 😂😂\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byJgRDFdUj0&amp;t=1263\">21:03</a> He literally lost patience at Ranveer&#39;s stupid question. Inviting a big celebrity is not important if you can&#39;t go in-depth with the subject. DO NOT TRY TOO HARD TO IMPRESS AN ENGLISH<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byJgRDFdUj0&amp;t=1304\">21:44</a> another roast. &#39;I don&#39;t think you understand the word Integrity&#39; and Ranveer was clueless\n\nNow at my life It is a great podcast and I want to say in this podcast 35 mints definitely change your mindset  and your thoughts, in my final words  I would say all of my indian  young generations please don&#39;t running blindly for the govt. Job prepare for business and become CAPITALIST.\n\nRobert kiyosaki living legend thanks for bringing him @TRS Ranveer bhai\n\nRanveer sir we really need such men on stage you&#39;re doing an amazing work buddy\n\nHe is just saying one thing again and again\n\nWe Respect and Love Robert Kiyosaki\n\nBro I thought this man is head of eluminaty 😂\n\nThis was the only podcast where Ranveer was struggling a little bit . But this gives a lot to us. Thank you Robert and Ranveer ❤\n\nAmazing 🌟🌟🌟\n\nBest podcast ever\n\nPoor questioning\n\nI think this podcast was not well-researched and this is what I felt for the first time. Robert felt being asked unrelated questions and Ranbeer seemed to follow the monotonous theme. The theme itself felt monotonous for the first time. Please invite him sometime soon for another conversation and talk about money, who knows what else beneficial comes out of his wiseness. Please try BeerBiceps!! Above all congratulationssss Ranbeer and BeerBiceps This was the biggest ever. Keep rocking guys\n\nI don&#39;t know why but i felt like he is not imparting any helpful things rather he has some agenda. The way he is constantly crticising some people with one same justification and promoting &quot;Trump&quot;. No doubt he is an intelligent man but contradiction in his words is quite visible. On one hand he talks about brotherhood and on the other he is full of strict thought process. He talked about integrity and liberty with that he is saying others to follow capitalism only.\n\nThank u so Mach❤❤\n\nConversations were getting complicated for some certain seconds\n\nHis pumping indian\n\nPeaceful 😂\n\nThe way Kiyosaki talked about bitcoin here just reminded me of my regrets for not following my instinct and bought bitcoin a few months ago when its price was between $20k and $25k. It&#39;s quite devastating now. In these bullish times, any suggestions for boosting earnings would be greatly valued.\n\nWhat’s he mean by coin is value over paper\n\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byJgRDFdUj0&amp;t=1229\">20:29</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byJgRDFdUj0&amp;t=1237\">20:37</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=byJgRDFdUj0&amp;t=1240\">20:40</a>\n\nI saw this podcast with great expectations. But got confused on whether ranveer asked wrong questions or he answered oddly.<br><br>Slowly realised, Robert came with answers only on money and always answered only about money irrespective of question asked.\n\nRanveer for the first time looked completely at sea! This man, Robert is a complete diff league. He is not your usual teenage friendly guest. He breaks the truth to you, if you are not ready you well not know what hit you, you don&#39;t have a clue.\n\nGreat personality both\n\nFrom my viewpoint : Robert is highly emphasising on silver and gold because solid resources are limited and at the end, when people will have more gold and silver will be the most safe and wealthy.<br><br>The dollar is linked with every economy and when the dollar falls, everyone falls.<br><br>Financial markets are regulated by banks and when banks greed never get over they can easily manipulate the world economy.<br><br>Only one solution : Banks have to stop being owners of countries and work towards creating stable world economies.<br><br>This unfortunately will never happen because banks are controlled by greed\n\nWell explained. Thank you for bringing up this video. Financial education is indeed required for more than 70% of the society  in the country as very few are literate on the subject ..... Thanks to Caitlin Jeffery the lady you recommended.....\n\nWorst beerbiceps podcast<br><br>You didn&#39;t even remotely know him<br>You didn&#39;t know what questions to ask<br>You didn&#39;t really get what he was saying<br><br>Possible questions<br><br>1.About the new central blockchain concept<br>2.about Biden and who is running the US<br>3.why did America fail?<br>4.what were his thoughts on the petro doller how does it work for the audience and what is it&#39;s future<br>5.could the brics currency replace doller anytime<br><br>And a lot more man you just wasted an hour with this legend\n\nbro ye hatho ko sidhe se rakh... bahut odd lagta hai ye jo bhi style hai\n\nNobody Cares ⚔️\n\nAdmi thoda teda lag raha hai.. ranveer bhi haka baka ho gya\n\nI normally don&#39;t comment on any video across YouTube, but these were  great teachings by Robert Sir. The only problem was the introduction to this great personality in this video by Ranveer was pretty casual/normal unlike he doing to any other guests. Maybe because of the length of the video. I don&#39;t know, but ya! He deserved a really really good introduction. That&#39;s just an opinion.\n\nBhai ky admi h ye , kesi ajeeb baite ke rha h itne smart insan ke sath , bhai littrally vo. Has rha h ispe har 2 min. Me jab ye samj nhi pa rha\n\nRanveer couldn&#39;t follow Robert closely and didnt understand his words. It was difficult for Ranveer to talk more about money to Robert. Asking about death and other things isnt relevant for this guest. Ranveer should have listened him well and should have asked more about practically implementing concepts from the book, more on real estate. Disliked the show, it was a waste of time for Robert because the host had difficulties understanding most of what Robert said. Better prepare next time Ranveer!\n\nUnbelievable you killed it ❤\n\nRanveer is trying to cool him down and everytime he does it , He is more serious 😂😂😂\n\nDude..... This your toughest guest ever.....  ... I can only imagine what you have gone through while dealing with this man... <br>...\n\n👏👏👏👏👏👏❣️\n\nRanveer didn&#39;t get a word, did he? LOl\n\nMy Man Robert is a straight forward speaker. No wonder why he and Trump are good friends.\n\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* **Read data**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# data = pd.read_csv('../input/blackadam-trailer-comments/comments.csv')\n# data.columns\n# data1=data.drop(['Unnamed: 0','Likes','Time','user','UserLink'],axis=1)\ndata1","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-30T21:10:55.272375Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-30T21:10:55.272765Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-30T21:10:55.284259Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-30T21:10:55.272733Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-30T21:10:55.282888Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* **Data labelling**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"nltk.download('vader_lexicon')\nsentiments = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()\ndata1[\"Positive\"] = [sentiments.polarity_scores(i)[\"pos\"] for i in data1[\"Comment\"]]\ndata1[\"Negative\"] = [sentiments.polarity_scores(i)[\"neg\"] for i in data1[\"Comment\"]]\ndata1[\"Neutral\"] = [sentiments.polarity_scores(i)[\"neu\"] for i in data1[\"Comment\"]]\ndata1['Compound'] = [sentiments.polarity_scores(i)[\"compound\"] for i in data1[\"Comment\"]]\nscore = data1[\"Compound\"].values\nsentiment = []\nfor i in score:\n    if i >= 0.05 :\n        sentiment.append('Positive')\n    elif i <= -0.05 :\n        sentiment.append('Negative')\n    else:\n        sentiment.append('Neutral')\ndata1[\"Sentiment\"] = sentiment\ndata1.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-31T15:36:51.875005Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-01-31T15:36:51.875689Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-31T15:36:52.376306Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-31T15:36:51.875635Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-31T15:36:52.374956Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"[nltk_data] Downloading package vader_lexicon to\n[nltk_data]     /usr/share/nltk_data...\n[nltk_data]   Package vader_lexicon is already up-to-date!\n","output_type":"stream"},{"execution_count":5,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"                                             Comment  Positive  Negative  \\\n0  Check out my Mind Performance app: Level Super...     0.000     0.000   \n1  Nothing is permanent but.
